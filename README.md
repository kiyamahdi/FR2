This program has a database to store user information.
To receive information from the user, a form for receiving information has been created using a graphical user interface.
The user environment is designed using the open_cv module and has created a virtual or spatial mode of using the keys.
To get the user's photo, he takes a photo of it while smiling and saves it in his folder and names it based on id.
This program works in such a way that if your profile and photo are in its data, it will display your information such as your name, surname, age and gender, and if it is not there, it will display the form to receive the information.
The modules used are:
open_cv 
face_recognition
numpy
mediapipe
sqlite3
